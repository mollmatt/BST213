# BST213_1

This is a repos with R code for all of my BST 213 Regression assignments. I developed the code to match SAS outputs to allow me to quickly obtain statistical measures of interest in the future.

Where possible, I coded things with variables so that the code can be transferrable to larger, more complex datasets.
